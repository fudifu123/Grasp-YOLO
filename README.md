Instance segmentation and point cloud processing based 6D pose estimation for real-time accurate robotic grasping of cluttered cheeses
## Notice on Code and Dataset Availability
Thank you for your interest in this project, Instance segmentation and point cloud processing based 6D pose estimation for real-time accurate robotic grasping of cluttered cheeses. To ensure compliance with institutional policies and confidentiality requirements, the source code and associated datasets for this work are not publicly available at this moment.

Premature disclosure of the implementation details and datasets may compromise the protection of these methodological contributions. Therefore, the current restriction on public access is also intended to safeguard the originality and novelty of the proposed approach. In line with our commitment to open science and reproducibility, we plan to release the full codebase and datasets after the official publication of the corresponding research article. Additionally, a demonstration video will be provided to illustrate the proposed method, including its implementation and deployment in practical robotic grasping scenarios, allowing viewers to gain a clear and intuitive understanding of the approach and its performance.

We sincerely appreciate your understanding and patience.

For any inquiries or requests for early access under specific academic collaboration agreements, please feel free to contact us.
